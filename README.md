<h1>Summary and Introduction</h1>

The project aims to develop a service robot equipped with line-following capability. 
The robot will track lines to transport trays, whether empty or filled, placed on shelves to the dishwashing area.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform line tracking, a triple tracker sensor is used in the project. 
Additionally, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor is positioned in front of the robot. 
It will halt the robot's movement when it detects an obstacle within 20 cm in front and will interpret a wave from a distance of 5 cm as a command to continue moving.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this IoT-focused project, the developed service robot is capable of smooth line tracking and can stop and move in obstacle situations. 
The robot operates as an automatic system, reducing workload and streamlining work processes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The significance of this project lies in the reduction of workload and the decreased likelihood of issues in industries through the use of automated systems. 
The service robot enhances efficiency in operations and brings a systematic approach to workflow processes.

<h1>Method</h1>

Design and Manufacturing of the Service Robot:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The design of the line-following service robot was completed. 
The robot was equipped with an appropriate transportation mechanism to carry both empty and filled trays. 
The mechanical and electronic components of the robot were manufactured using suitable materials.

Line Tracking Process:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line tracking was achieved using a triple tracker sensor. 
The tracker sensor was placed under the robot and utilized for tracking the line. 
The sensor detected its position on the line, guiding the robot's movement. 
Necessary adjustments were made for the correct functioning of the tracker sensor and data analysis.

Detection of Obstacles and Motion Control:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor was used to detect obstacles in front of the robot. 
The sensor was programmed to halt the robot's movement when it detected an obstacle at a distance of 20 cm. 
Additionally, a hand gesture made at a distance of 5 cm was interpreted as a command to continue moving. 
Motor control was carried out based on data collected from the sensors.

Testing and Evaluation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The developed service robot underwent evaluation through tests conducted in a laboratory environment. 
Its line tracking capability, obstacle detection, and motion control performance were assessed. 
The robot's success in fulfilling its intended task was evaluated.

Results:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A line-following service robot was developed and successfully operated.

The robot transported empty or filled trays from shelves to the dishwasher by following a line.

The line tracking process was achieved using a triple tracker sensor.

When an obstacle was detected 20 cm in front of the robot, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor halted the robot's movement.

A hand gesture made at a distance of 5 cm from the distance sensor was interpreted as a command to continue the robot's movement.

Assessment:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project demonstrates the successful results of work on a line-following service robot. 
The robot has successfully performed its task of transporting trays from the shelves to the dishwashing area by following a line. 
The line-following process, realized using a triple tracker sensor, ensured the robot's accurate movement. 
Additionally, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor provided safety by detecting obstacles in front of the robot. 
The continuation command given through hand gestures facilitated user interaction. 
The outcomes of this project emphasize the potential of line-following service robots to streamline tasks in industrial settings and underscore the importance of automated systems. 
However, it should be noted that there are some disadvantages, such as limited load capacity and issues related to external factors like light or floor conditions affecting the performance of the tracker sensor. 
These results showcase the potential and areas for improvement in service robots.
